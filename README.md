# keg_tracker
Basic command-line program for tracking the location, contents, and other status data for beer kegs with an ID number.

The program currently pickles data in a file in the users local storage. For user interface, it implements a somewhat verbose method of checking for valid data that is more user-friendly than argparse.

Future versions will include more bulk-editing capability and some built-in production data analysis for richer reporting.
